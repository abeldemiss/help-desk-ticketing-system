# Help Desk Ticketing System & Active Directory Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a functional IT help desk environment within a home lab. It showcases the integration of core IT infrastructure components, including virtualization, Windows Server administration with Active Directory, and a ticketing system (osTicket)..

The primary goals are:
*   To build a virtualized lab environment simulating a small business network.
*   To configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for centralized user management and authentication.
*   To deploy and customize the osTicket ticketing system for managing IT support requests.
*   To illustrate common IT support workflows, from ticket intake to resolution.

This repository serves as documentation for the setup process and can be used to quickly understand the project's architecture and the skills involved.

## Technologies Used

*   **Virtualization:** VMware Workstation Pro 17.x
*   **Operating Systems:**
    *   Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller, IIS Host)
    *   Windows 10 Pro (Client Machine)
*   **Directory Service:** Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
*   **Web Server:** Internet Information Services (IIS) 10
*   **Scripting/Backend:** PHP 8.x (NTS)
*   **Database:** MySQL 8.x (with MySQL Workbench)
*   **Ticketing System:** osTicket v1.18.x

## Project Components

### 1. Lab Environment Setup (Virtualization)

The foundation of the lab is built using VMware Workstation Pro. This allows for the creation and management of isolated virtual machines for the server and client components.

*   **Setup:** Installation of VMware Workstation Pro and enabling hardware virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V).
    *   See: [`Lab-Setup/Virtualization.md`](Lab-Setup/Virtualization.md)
*   **Server VM:** A Windows Server 2022 VM (`SRV-DC01`) was created with appropriate resources (RAM, CPU, Disk) and configured with a static IP address. VMware Tools were installed for better integration.
    *   See: [`Lab-Setup/WindowsServer-VM.md`](Lab-Setup/WindowsServer-VM.md)
*   **Client VM:** A Windows 10 Pro VM was created, configured with NAT networking, and VMware Tools installed. This VM acts as the end-user machine for testing domain joining and accessing the ticketing system.
    *   See: [`Lab-Setup/Windows10-VM.md`](Lab-Setup/Windows10-VM.md)
    *   ![Windows 10 Desktop](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/windows10-desktop/windows10-desktop5.png)

### 2. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

A core part of this project is the configuration of Active Directory on the Windows Server 2022 VM.

*   **Installation:** The AD DS role was installed via Server Manager.
    *   ![AD DS Role Installation](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/add-roles.png)
*   **Domain Controller Promotion:** The server was promoted to a Domain Controller for a new forest (e.g., `mydomain.local`).
    *   ![DC Promotion](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/promote.png)
    *   ![Forest Configuration](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/forest.png)
*   **User & OU Management:** Organizational Units (e.g., `Employees`) and test user accounts (e.g., `john.doe`, `jane.smith`) were created within Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).
    *   ![ADUC Verification](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/verify.png)
    *   ![Test Users](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/users.png)
*   **Client Domain Join:** The Windows 10 VM was successfully joined to the `mydomain.local` domain.
    *   ![Domain Join Verification](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/join.png)
*   **DNS Configuration:** DNS settings were configured on both the Domain Controller and the client VM to ensure proper name resolution within the domain.
*   **File Sharing:** Basic file sharing was configured on the server, demonstrating NTFS and Share permissions for domain users.
    *   ![Share Settings](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/share.png)
    *   ![Security Settings](Lab-Setup/Screenshots/ad-setup/secure.png)
*   **Details:** [`Lab-Setup/Active-Directory.md`](Lab-Setup/Active-Directory.md)

### 3. osTicket Help Desk System

osTicket was deployed on the Windows Server VM using IIS, PHP, and MySQL to provide a functional ticketing system.

*   **Prerequisites Installation (IIS, PHP, MySQL):**
    *   IIS was installed and configured with the CGI feature.
    *   PHP (Non-Thread Safe) was downloaded, configured (`php.ini`), and integrated with IIS via Handler Mappings.
    *   MySQL Server and Workbench were installed, and a dedicated database (`osticket`) and user (`osticketuser`) were created for osTicket.
    *   See: [`Ticketing-System/Installation.md`](Ticketing-System/Installation.md)
    *   ![IIS Role Selection](Ticketing-System/Screenshots/Installation/IIS.png)
    *   ![PHP Handler Mapping](Ticketing-System/Screenshots/Installation/php-iis.png)
    *   ![MySQL DB Creation](Ticketing-System/Screenshots/Installation/db.png)
*   **osTicket Installation:** The osTicket application files were placed in the webroot (`C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\osTicket`), and the web-based setup was completed.
*   **osTicket Configuration:** The system was customized to simulate a professional help desk:
    *   **Departments:** Created distinct support departments (e.g., `IT Support`, `Network Operations`).
        *   ![Departments](Ticketing-System/Screenshots/Configuration/departments.png)
    *   **Staff & Roles:** Defined staff accounts and roles (Level 1, Level 2, Administrator) with specific permissions. Created support teams.
        *   ![Staff Roles](Ticketing-System/Screenshots/Configuration/staff-roles.png)
    *   **Help Topics:** Configured relevant help topics (e.g., `Password Reset`, `Network Connectivity`) linked to appropriate departments and priorities.
        *   ![Help Topics](Ticketing-System/Screenshots/Configuration/help-topics.png)
    *   **SLAs:** Defined Service Level Agreement plans (Urgent, High, Normal, Low) based on business hours and grace periods.
        *   ![SLA Plans](Ticketing-System/Screenshots/Configuration/sla-plans.png)
    *   **User Auth:** Configured basic user settings (Note: While AD integration is possible via plugins, this setup focuses on core osTicket configuration).
    *   See: [`Ticketing-System/Configuration.md`](Ticketing-System/Configuration.md)
*   **Ticket Lifecycle Demonstration:** Sample tickets illustrate the flow from user submission (via web portal) through agent assignment, troubleshooting (including interaction with AD for a password reset), internal notes, user communication, and resolution.
    *   See: [`Ticketing-System/Sample-Tickets.md`](Ticketing-System/Sample-Tickets.md)
